# Project Managers
Project managers have responsibilities such as managing a projectâ€™s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, members, repositories, and legal aspects like the CLA. You use the CLA Management Console.

Do the following CLA set-up steps after you Sign In to the CLA Management Console:

1. [Install the EasyCLA Application](Install-the-EasyCLA-Application.md).

2. [Add a CLA Group](Add-a-CLA-Group.md).

3. [Add Contributor License Agreements](Add-Contributor-License-Agreements.md).

4. [Add Gerrit Instances to CLA Monitoring or Delete Them From CLA Monitoring](Add-Gerrit-Instances-to-CLA-Monitoring-or-Delete-Them-From-CLA-Monitoring.md).

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [View Current and Previous CLA PDFs](View-Current-and-Previous-CLA-PDFs.md)

* [Manage CLA Group Details](Manage-CLA-Group-Details.md)
