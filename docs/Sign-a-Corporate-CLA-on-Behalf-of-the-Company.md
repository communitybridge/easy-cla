# Sign a Corporate CLA on Behalf of the Company
As a CLA signatory, you need to have the authority within your company to sign a Corporate CLA on its behalf. If you are a CLA manager but not a CLA signatory, you can request that the CLA signatory sign the Corporate CLA.

**Do these steps:**

1. [Sign in](Sign-In-to-the-CLA-Corporate-Console.md).

   The CLA Corporate Console appears and shows Companies.

1. Click the company for which you want to sign a Corporate CLA.

1. Click **NEW CLA**.

[The CLA Signatory receives a CLA Sign Request](Review-and-Sign-a-Corporate-CLA-by-Request.md) email and reviews and signs the document.

After the Corporate CLA is signed, the Company page shows the signed Corporate CLA under Signed Project CCLAs. You receive a CLA Signed Document email with an attached document PDF. Contributors to the company project simply need to confirm their association to the company, and then they can continue with their pull requests. Their subsequent contributions will not require association confirmations.

*A Corporate CLA that is signed by the CLA signatory remains in effect even when that CLA signatory is no longer employed at a company.*
