# GitHub Bot Approved List

Each project will need to approved any bots that open pull requests on GitHub. To accomplish this, at least one company with a signed a Corporate CLA under the project in question will need to list the bot's GitHub Username within their GitHub approved list.

Once you have completed the steps to add the bot to your approved list, the bot should appear in your Employee Acknowledgments
