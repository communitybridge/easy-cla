# CLA Managers and CLA Signatories
As the CLA manager or the CLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you Sign In to the CLA Corporate Console:

1. CLA manager: [Add a Company to a Project](Add-a-Company-to-a-Project.md).

2. CLA signatory: [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](Sign-a-Corporate-CLA-on-Behalf-of-the-Company.md) and  [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](Review-and-Sign-a-Corporate-CLA-by-Request.md)—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

3. CLA manager: [Whitelist Contributors](Whitelist-Contributors.md)—each whitelist applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [Add or Delete CLA Managers](Add-or-Delete-CLA-Managers.md)

* [View Employee Acknowledgements](View-Employee-Acknowledgements.md)

* [Edit the Company Name and Manager Details](Edit-the-Company-Name-and-Manager-Details.md)
