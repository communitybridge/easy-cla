In an email to the CLA Admin team, include:
1. Your LF ID
2. Your Project's Name

# CLA Manager and Maintainer Onboarding
You can immediately start using the CLA Corporate Console because it does not require activation from the EasyCLA administration team.

1. Log in to the CLA Corporate Console. 
2. Sign a CCLA on behalf of your companies.
3. Whitelist domains (for example, linuxfoundation.org)
 - Everyone who contributes to your codebase with emails that match the domains you add will automatically be covered by your signed CCLA.
5. Whitelist individual employee contributors.
 - Everyone who contributes to your codebase with emails that **DO NOT** match the domains you add will automatically be covered by your signed CCLA when you add them to this list.
