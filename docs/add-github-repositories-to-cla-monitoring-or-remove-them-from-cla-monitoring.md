2. Click a **project** of interest.

   The project page appears.

4. For the repository that you want to configure, click an option:

   **ADD** enables CLA enforcement on the repository. After you add a repository, the REMOVE option appears next to the repository.

   **REMOVE** disables CLA enforcement on the repository. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.

   **ADD ALL REPOS** adds all repositories for the corresponding GitHub Organization to CLA enforcement. After you add the repositories the REMOVE option appears next to each repository.

   **REMOVE ALL REPOS** removes all repositories for the corresponding GitHub Organization from CLA enforcement. After you remove the repositories the ADD option appears next to each repository.

   **DISABLED** indicates that the repository has been configured for another CLA group and thus cannot be configured for the selected CLA group.

5. Click **CLOSE**.

   The CLA Management Console appears. Repositories shows a checkmark next to each repository that EasyCLA will monitor for the organization and the CLA group.
