# Get Access to EasyCLA

**Important:** Before you get started, make sure your project meets the [EasyCLA Requirements](https://app.gitbook.com/@lf-docs-linux-foundation/s/easycla/getting-started/easycla-requirements).

**As the project manager, do these steps to get access to EasyCLA:**

1. If you do not have a Linux Foundation identification and credentials, go to [https://identity.linuxfoundation.org](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org) and complete the form to sign up.
2. Share your sign-up username with the CLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).
3. Provide sample ICLA and CCLA template documents to the CLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).

After the CLA administration team confirms your setup, you can [Sign In to the CLA Management Console](https://app.gitbook.com/@lf-docs-linux-foundation/s/easycla/getting-started/project-managers/sign-in-to-the-cla-management-console) to do the EasyCLA activities for [project managers](https://app.gitbook.com/@lf-docs-linux-foundation/s/easycla/getting-started/project-managers).

**Note:** CCLA managers can immediately start using the CLA Corporate Console because it does not require activation from the EasyCLA administration team. Simply [Sign In to the CLA Corporate Console](https://app.gitbook.com/@lf-docs-linux-foundation/s/easycla/getting-started/ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console) to do the EasyCLA activities for [CCLA Managers and CCLA Signatories](https://app.gitbook.com/@lf-docs-linux-foundation/s/easycla/getting-started/ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories).
