# Project Managers

Project managers have responsibilities such as managing a projectâ€™s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, members, repositories, and legal aspects like the CLA. You use the CLA Management Console.

Do the following CLA set-up steps after you [sign in to the CLA Management Console]():

1. [Install the EasyCLA Application]().
2. [Add a CLA Group]().
3. [Add Contributor License Agreements]().
4. [Add Gerrit Instances to CLA Monitoring or Delete Them From CLA Monitoring]().

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [View Current and Previous CLA PDFs]()
* [Manage CLA Group Details]()
