# Approved List Contributors

The Approved List are lists of domain names, email addresses of individuals, GitHub usernames, or GitHub organization names who are authorized to contribute under a signed Corporate CLA. As a CCLA manager, you allow contributions to projects on behalf of your company by using any Approved List:

* Domain Approved List allows entities to contribute under any email address under that domain name.
* Email Approved List allows entities to contribute under an individual email address.
* GitHub Approved List allows entities to contribute under a GitHub username.
* GitHub Organization Approved List allows entities to contribute under a GitHub organization name.

Each Approved List applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA. The CLA application checks all the whitelists for allowing contributions to a company project. A contributor only needs to be on one Approved List. Contributors can use EasyCLA to send email requests to be associated \(whitelisted\) with the company.

_Multiple CCLA managers cannot add to the Approved List the same domain and sign a CCLA for the same company._

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md).

   The CLA Corporate Console appears and shows Companies.

2. Click a **company** of interest.

## Domain Approved List, Email Approved List, or GitHub Approved List

The corresponding Edit _domain/email/github_ Approved List dialog lets you add, edit, and delete values to a Approved List so that employees \(developers\) can be associated to the company. An example domain name value is joesbikes.com. A wildcard whitelists the domain and all subdomains, for example: \*.joesbikes.com or \*joesbikes.com would Approved List joes.bikes.com, shop.joesbikes.com, and blog.joesbikes.com.

**Note:** To remove an entry from the Approved List, click **X** next to the item, and click **SAVE**.
