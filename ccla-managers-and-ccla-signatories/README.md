# CLA Managers and CLA Signatories

As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console]():

1. CCLA manager: [Add a Company to a Project]().
2. CCLA signatory: [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company]() and [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request]()—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.
3. CCLA manager: [Whitelist Contributors]()—each whitelist applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [Add or Delete CCLA Managers]()
* [View Employee Acknowledgements]()
* [Edit the Company Name and Manager Details]()
