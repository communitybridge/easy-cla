# CLA Managers and CLA Signatories

As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md):

1. CCLA manager: [Add a Company to a Project](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/add-a-company-to-a-project.md).
2. CCLA signatory: [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/sign-a-corporate-cla-on-behalf-of-the-company.md) and [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md)—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.
3. CCLA manager: [Whitelist Contributors](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/whitelist-contributors.md)—each whitelist applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [Add or Delete CCLA Managers](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/add-or-delete-ccla-managers.md)
* [View Employee Acknowledgements](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/view-employee-acknowledgements.md)
* [Edit the Company Name and Manager Details](../ccla-managers-and-ccla-signatories/edit-the-company-name-and-manager-details.md)
