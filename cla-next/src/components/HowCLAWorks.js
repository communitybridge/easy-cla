          Below is a high-level flow of how EasyCLA works. <span><b>The Project Manager</b></span> (who can be a project maintainer or someone from the Linux Foundation, depending on how youâ€™ve been set up) starts the process by setting up their preferred CLA.
          </p>

          <p>
          Once EasyCLA has been enabled to enforce agreements, the workflow starts when a Developer attempts to contribution to the project. Detailed user steps can be found in our public documentation on GitHub.
